## Introduction

Welcome to **WhatExpsAre.Online** (“we”, “our”, or “us”).  
We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about what data is collected when you use our website, why it’s collected, and how it’s handled.

This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

---

## Information We Collect

We do not create user accounts or directly store personal data on our own servers. However, when you use our website, certain information is automatically collected through third-party services we use for analytics, performance, and security.

### Analytics
- **Google Analytics**: Collects anonymized usage information, such as pages visited, time spent on site, and general device/browser details.  
  You can learn more in the [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **PostHog**: Collects similar anonymized analytics data to help us understand how the site performs and is used.

### Security & Performance
- **Cloudflare**: Provides DDoS protection, caching, and firewall services. Cloudflare may log IP addresses, request details, and security events (e.g., blocked requests).  
  This is especially relevant when accessing API routes such as:
- /api/status/exploits 
- /api/versions/current\


These logs are primarily used for security and are not tied to user identities.

---

## Cookies & Tracking

Our analytics providers (Google Analytics and PostHog) may use cookies or similar technologies to collect anonymized usage information.  
You can disable cookies through your browser settings, though some features of the site may not work as intended.

---

## How We Use Collected Information

The data we collect is used for:
1. **Improving our website** – to understand traffic patterns and performance.  
2. **Ensuring security** – protecting against abuse, spam, and malicious activity.  
3. **Maintaining availability** – optimizing our services and preventing downtime.

We **do not sell or share** your personal information with third parties for advertising or marketing.

---

## Data Retention

- Analytics and security logs are typically retained for **about 30 days**.  
- We do not maintain a long-term database of personal information.  
- Once logs are automatically deleted by our providers, we no longer have access to them.

---

## Children’s Privacy

Our website is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.  
If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us and we will ensure it is removed.

---

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your data, including:

- **Access** – You may request details of any personal information we have (though most data is anonymized or only held temporarily by third parties).  
- **Correction** – You may request corrections to inaccurate data.  
- **Deletion** – You may request deletion of your data, subject to the limits of our third-party providers.

---

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of the site after changes are made will constitute acceptance of the updated policy.
